- Accent color: Teal (#14B8A6) for interactive elements, providing contrast and highlighting key actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- Use a consistent set of line icons to visually represent task statuses, priorities, and labels. Aim for clarity and intuitive recognition.
- Implement a clean and structured layout with clear separation between the navigation, task lists, and detail views.
- Use subtle animations for task status transitions, notifications, and loading states to enhance user experience without being distracting.
